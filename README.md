# üöÄ netlistJSReducer

**Welcome to the repository description.** This project is a netlist reducer in pure Javascript, you can combine the parallel and series elements of circuit into a single impedance.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why is this benefical?

For example,if you have a complex network and you need to calculate some impedance, admittance or other values, it is best to keep your network as simple as possible. Short: The fewer parts, the easier it is to count.

## ‚≠ê Features / Limits of this version (v.1.0)

  **This script can**
  - calculate with **resistor**, **capacitor** and **inductor**,
  - calculate with complex numbers,
  - combine paralell and series items into a single impedance,
  - make **netlist** output string.
